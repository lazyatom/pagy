# Pagy on Docker

This dir contains a few files to setup a development environment without installing anything on your system.

You can use it to develop changes, run tests and check a live preview of the documentation.

### Overview

The pagy docker environment has been designed to be useful for developing:

- It provides the infrastructure required (right version of ruby, jekyll server, env variable, tests, etc.) without the hassle to install and maintain anything in your system
- The local `pagy` dir is mounted at the container dir `/opt/project` so you can edit the files in your local pagy dir or in the container: they are the same files.
- The gems are installed in the container `BUNDLE_PATH=/usr/local/bundle` and that dir is `chown`ed to your user, and mounted as the docker volume `pagy_bundle`. You can use the `bundle` command and it will be persisted in the volume, no need to rebuild the image nor pollute your own system.
- Your container user `HOME` is preserved in the `pagy_user_home` volume, so you can even get back to the shell history in future sessions.


## Prerequisites

- recent `docker`
- recent `docker-compose`
- basic knowledge of docker/docker-compose

## Start it

Set in your IDE or system a few variables about your user:

- the `GROUP` name (get it with `id -gn` in the terminal)
- the `UID` (get it with `id -u` in the terminal)
- the `GID` (get it with `id -g` in the terminal)

You can also specify a few other variables used in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

If you already set the variables:

```sh
cd docker
docker-compose build pagy3 pagy-jekyll
```

or just set it with the command. For example:

```sh
cd docker
GROUP=dd UID=1000 GID=1000 && docker-compose build pagy pagy-jekyll
```

The first time it will also build the images, from then on it will just run the containers for the pagy environment (you can inspect the `docker-compose.yml` file for more details).

## Use it

Run the containers from the docker dir:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Open a terminal in the pagy container and run the usual `bundle install` to install the gems into the `pagy_bundle` volume.

Then you cou can run `irb -Ilib -r pagy` from the container in order to have `pagy` loaded and ready to try.

Run all the tests by simply running `rake` without arguments.

The `gh-pages` service runs the jekyll server so you can edit the docs files from the local `pagy` dir and have a real-time preview of your changes at `http://localhost:4000`. You don't even need to reload the page in the browser to see the change you do in the `*.md` page file.

If you are serious about developing, you can integrate this environment with some good IDE that provides docker and ruby integration. I currently use it for all the basic pagy development, fully integrated with [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/?from=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fddnexus%2Fpagy).

## Clean up

When you want to get rid of everything related to the `pagy` development on your system:

- `rm -rf /path/to/pagy`
- `docker rmi pagy pagy-gh-pages` or `docker rmi pagy:3 pagy-gh-pages` if you don't want to remove other versions (e.g. `pagy:4`)
- `docker volume rm pagy3_bundle pagy3_user_home pagy3_docs_site`
- `docker system prune` (not pagy related but good for reclaiming storage space from docker)

## Caveats

- If you use different pagy images for different pagy versions/branches:
  - Remember to checkout the right branch before using it
  - If you test with `RUN_SIMPLECOV` you may need to `rm -rf coverage` or you may get some error that will not allow you to test
